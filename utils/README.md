# Windows Programs

For convenience (and because they're not very big) I have gathered the collection of programs for Windows that are called by the makefile to disassemble, process and reassemble the VIC-20 JETPAC binary code.

I recommend you visit the original source of these programs and review the latest versions, some are in active development and may give you added features.

Linux/Mac users will need to change the program paths in the makefile to use same programs delivered with, or complied for, your distro.

Some of these versions may be 64-bit programs, in which case they will not run on 32-bit hardware, you may need to seek out a 32-bit alternative.
